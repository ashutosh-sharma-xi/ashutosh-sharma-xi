I am Ashutosh, In 2022 I find Myself as an Ambitios, Bodacious and Creative guy who is currently a Data Science Enthusiast and looking for someone to help in taking Data Driven Decisions. 

I'm looking for opportunities in the field where I can utilize my skills and knowledge to make an impact.

Apart from my love for data science, I'm also enthusiastic about new tech-savvy things, marketing, and entrepreneurship. I believe in staying up-to-date with the latest trends and innovations in these fields, which is essential to succeed in today's fast-paced world.
